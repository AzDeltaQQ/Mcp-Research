# Cursor AI MCP Implementation

## Overview

Cursor AI is an intelligent code editor that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to extend its capabilities through external servers. This document focuses on understanding Cursor AI's MCP implementation to inform our development of MCP servers specifically for Cursor AI integration.

## Cursor AI MCP Integration

Cursor AI integrates with MCP servers through its Composer feature, allowing the AI to access external tools and data sources. The integration works as follows:

1. **Configuration Setup**: Cursor AI provides a dedicated MCP configuration section in its settings:
   - Navigate to Cursor Settings > Features > MCP
   - Click the "+ Add New MCP Server" button

2. **Server Definition**: Each MCP server is defined with:
   - Name: A nickname for the server
   - Type: The transport type (stdio or sse)
   - Command/URL: Either a shell command (for stdio) or URL endpoint (for SSE)

3. **Transport Options**:
   - **Stdio Server**: Uses standard input/output for communication
     - Example: `node ~/mcp-quickstart/weather-server-typescript/build/index.js`
   - **SSE Server**: Uses Server-Sent Events for server-to-client messages
     - Example: `http://example.com:8000/sse`

4. **Tool Discovery and Usage**:
   - After adding a server, it appears in the MCP servers list
   - Tools may need to be refreshed to populate in the tool list
   - The Composer Agent automatically uses MCP tools when relevant
   - Users can explicitly prompt tool usage by:
     - Referring to the tool by name
     - Describing the tool's function

5. **Tool Execution Process**:
   - Displays a message in chat requesting approval
   - Shows tool call arguments (expandable)
   - Executes the tool upon user approval
   - Displays the tool's response in the chat

## Cursor AI-Specific Requirements

1. **Integration Point**: Cursor AI integrates MCP through its Composer feature, which is its AI-powered coding assistant.

2. **Configuration Interface**: Cursor provides a graphical interface for adding and managing MCP servers.

3. **Transport Support**: Cursor supports both stdio and SSE transport mechanisms.

4. **Security Model**: Cursor implements a permission system where users must approve MCP server actions before execution.

5. **Tool Visibility**: Tools provided by MCP servers appear in Cursor's interface and can be invoked through natural language.

## MCP Server Ecosystem for Cursor

Cursor has a growing ecosystem of MCP servers available through platforms like:

1. **Smithery.ai**: A registry of MCP servers with installation instructions
   - Popular servers include Sequential Thinking, GitHub, and various database connectors

2. **Cursor Directory**: A collection of MCP servers specifically designed for Cursor
   - Includes servers for various services like Brave Search, PostgreSQL, Docker, etc.

## Implementation Considerations for Cursor AI

When implementing MCP servers for Cursor AI, consider:

1. **Transport Preference**: While Cursor supports both stdio and SSE, stdio is more commonly used for local development.

2. **Command Format**: Cursor expects a valid shell command for stdio servers, typically pointing to a Node.js script.

3. **Tool Discoverability**: Ensure tools are properly registered so they appear in Cursor's tool list.

4. **User Experience**: Design tools that integrate naturally with Cursor's coding workflow.

5. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling as Cursor will display errors to users.

## Conclusion

Cursor AI provides a robust implementation of the Model Context Protocol, allowing developers to extend its capabilities through custom MCP servers. The configuration process is straightforward, and the growing ecosystem of available servers demonstrates the versatility of this approach. When implementing MCP servers specifically for Cursor AI, developers should focus on creating tools that enhance the coding experience while following Cursor's implementation patterns.
