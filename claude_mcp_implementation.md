# Claude MCP Implementation

## Overview

Claude implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) primarily through Claude Desktop, which allows the AI to interact with external data sources and tools through standardized MCP servers. This document focuses on understanding Claude's MCP implementation to inform our development of MCP servers specifically for Cursor AI.

## Claude Desktop MCP Integration

Claude Desktop serves as a client in the MCP architecture, connecting to MCP servers that provide various functionalities. The integration works as follows:

1. **Configuration Setup**: Claude Desktop uses a configuration file to define which MCP servers it can connect to:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. **Server Definition**: Each MCP server is defined in the configuration with:
   - A unique name identifier
   - Command to execute the server
   - Arguments to pass to the server

3. **Security Model**: Claude Desktop runs commands with the permissions of the user account and requires user approval before executing MCP server actions.

## Example Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/Users/username/Desktop",
        "/Users/username/Downloads"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## MCP Server Integration Process

1. **Server Registration**: MCP servers are registered in the Claude Desktop configuration file
2. **Server Initialization**: When Claude Desktop starts, it initializes connections to the configured MCP servers
3. **Tool Discovery**: Claude discovers available tools from the connected MCP servers
4. **Tool Invocation**: When appropriate, Claude requests to use tools from the MCP servers
5. **User Approval**: Claude Desktop requests user approval before executing MCP server actions
6. **Result Processing**: Claude processes the results returned by the MCP server

## Claude-Specific Requirements

1. **Node.js Dependency**: Claude Desktop's MCP implementation requires Node.js to be installed on the user's system.

2. **Transport Mechanism**: Claude Desktop primarily uses stdio transport for communication with MCP servers.

3. **Permission Model**: Claude implements a permission system where users must approve MCP server actions before execution.

4. **Configuration Format**: Claude requires a specific JSON configuration format for defining MCP servers.

5. **Tool Visibility**: Tools provided by MCP servers appear in the Claude Desktop interface with a hammer icon.

## Key Differences from Cursor AI Implementation

While Claude Desktop provides a reference implementation of MCP, our focus is on implementing MCP servers specifically for Cursor AI. Key differences to consider:

1. **Integration Point**: Instead of integrating with Claude Desktop, our implementation will focus on Cursor AI's specific requirements.

2. **Configuration Mechanism**: Cursor AI may have different configuration requirements than Claude Desktop.

3. **User Interface**: The way tools are presented and approved may differ in Cursor AI compared to Claude Desktop.

4. **Security Model**: Cursor AI may implement different security boundaries and permission models.

## Conclusion

Understanding Claude's MCP implementation provides valuable insights into how MCP servers are structured and integrated with AI applications. However, our implementation will need to be tailored specifically for Cursor AI, taking into account its unique requirements and integration points.
