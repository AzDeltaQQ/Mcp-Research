# MCP Server Requirements for Cursor AI

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Transport Mechanisms

- **Stdio Transport**:
  - Most commonly used for local development with Cursor AI
  - Requires a command-line executable that can read from stdin and write to stdout
  - Must follow JSON-RPC 2.0 message format for communication
  - Example command: `node ~/path/to/server/index.js`

- **SSE Transport**:
  - Alternative for remote or web-based servers
  - Requires an HTTP endpoint that supports Server-Sent Events
  - Uses HTTP POST for client-to-server messages
  - Example URL: `http://example.com:8000/sse`

### 2. Protocol Implementation

- Must implement the Model Context Protocol specification
- Must handle all required message types:
  - Requests (expecting responses)
  - Results (successful responses)
  - Errors (failed requests)
  - Notifications (one-way messages)
- Must support initialization handshake with Cursor AI
- Must properly register resources and tools

### 3. Security Considerations

- Should implement appropriate security boundaries
- Should validate all inputs from the client
- Should restrict operations to authorized paths/resources
- Should provide clear information about tool capabilities for user approval

## Server Architecture

### 1. Core Components

- **Transport Handler**:
  - Manages communication with Cursor AI
  - Parses incoming messages and formats outgoing messages
  - Implements either stdio or SSE transport

- **Protocol Handler**:
  - Processes JSON-RPC 2.0 messages
  - Maintains request/response mapping
  - Handles error conditions

- **Resource Manager**:
  - Defines available resources (e.g., `file://system`)
  - Registers tools associated with each resource
  - Provides tool metadata for discovery

- **Tool Implementations**:
  - Individual functions that perform specific tasks
  - Accept parameters and return results
  - Include proper error handling

### 2. Message Flow

1. **Initialization**:
   - Server starts and waits for connection
   - Cursor AI connects and sends initialization message
   - Server responds with capabilities and available tools

2. **Tool Discovery**:
   - Cursor AI requests list of available tools
   - Server responds with tool definitions and metadata

3. **Tool Execution**:
   - Cursor AI sends tool execution request
   - Server validates request and executes tool
   - Server returns results or error

4. **Termination**:
   - Either party can send termination message
   - Server should clean up resources

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### 1. Development Environment

- **Node.js**: Most MCP servers for Cursor AI are built with Node.js
  - Minimum version: Node.js 14.x or higher
  - npm or yarn for package management

- **TypeScript** (recommended):
  - Provides type safety and better development experience
  - Requires compilation step before execution

### 2. Required Libraries

- **MCP SDK**:
  - `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` - Core MCP implementation
  - Provides server, client, and transport implementations

- **JSON-RPC Libraries**:
  - For parsing and formatting JSON-RPC 2.0 messages
  - Typically included in the MCP SDK

- **Domain-Specific Libraries**:
  - Depends on the functionality of your MCP server
  - Examples: file system access, database connectors, API clients

### 3. Deployment Considerations

- **Local Development**:
  - Cursor AI can run MCP servers directly from local filesystem
  - Requires proper path configuration in Cursor settings

- **Containerization** (optional):
  - Docker for packaging and distribution
  - Simplifies dependency management
  - Requires proper volume mounting for file access

- **Distribution**:
  - npm package for easy installation
  - GitHub repository for source code access
  - Documentation for setup and usage

## Cursor AI-Specific Requirements

### 1. Configuration Format

- Cursor AI expects a specific format in its MCP server configuration:
  - Name: Descriptive name for the server
  - Type: Transport type (stdio or sse)
  - Command/URL: Command line or URL endpoint

### 2. Tool Discovery

- Tools must be properly registered to appear in Cursor's tool list
- Tool names should be descriptive and follow consistent naming conventions
- Tool descriptions should clearly explain functionality

### 3. User Experience

- Tools should integrate naturally with Cursor's coding workflow
- Tool execution should provide clear feedback
- Error messages should be user-friendly and actionable

### 4. Performance Considerations

- MCP servers should respond quickly to maintain a smooth user experience
- Long-running operations should provide progress updates
- Resource usage should be optimized for development environments

## Conclusion

Implementing an MCP server for Cursor AI requires careful attention to both the technical requirements of the Model Context Protocol and the specific integration points with Cursor's interface. By following the architecture and requirements outlined in this document, developers can create MCP servers that seamlessly extend Cursor AI's capabilities with custom tools and data sources.
