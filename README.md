- **claude_mcp_implementation.md**: Details on Claude's MCP implementation
- **cursor_ai_specifics.md**: Cursor AI's specific requirements and integration points
- **mcp_server_requirements.md**: Technical requirements for MCP servers
- **implementation_steps.md**: Step-by-step guide for implementing MCP servers
- **comprehensive_report.md**: Complete research findings in a single document
- **code_examples/**: Directory containing sample MCP server implementations
  - **basic_mcp_server.js**: Simple JavaScript MCP server with text tools
  - **advanced_mcp_server.ts**: Advanced TypeScript MCP server with file system operations
  - **weather_api_integration.ts**: Example of integrating with external APIs

## Getting Started

For a quick overview, start with the comprehensive_report.md file, which contains all the research findings in a single document. For specific topics, refer to the individual files listed above.

To implement your own MCP server for Cursor AI, follow these steps:

1. Read the implementation_steps.md file for a step-by-step guide
2. Review the code examples in the code_examples/ directory
3. Set up your development environment as described in the guide
4. Implement your custom tools based on the examples
5. Configure Cursor AI to use your MCP server

## Code Examples

The code examples demonstrate different aspects of MCP server implementation:

1. **Basic MCP Server (JavaScript)**: A simple server with text manipulation and calculation tools
2. **Advanced MCP Server (TypeScript)**: A more sophisticated server with file system operations and security boundaries
3. **Weather API Integration (TypeScript)**: An example of integrating with external APIs (OpenWeatherMap)

These examples can be used as starting points for your own MCP server implementations.

## Requirements

To run the code examples, you'll need:

- Node.js 14.x or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- TypeScript (for TypeScript examples)
- Cursor AI with MCP support

## Additional Resources
